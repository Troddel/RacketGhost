# RacketGhost

- Ghosting Coach for Squash & Badminton 

## Background

Ghosting is an established training exercise in racket sports to practice court movement without a ball. Running to the various corners of the court improves both footwork and general stamina. In the best of worlds, your coach or sparring partner will always be ready to point you to random corners at a pace that pushes you to your limits.

Unfortunately, few people have access to a coach at all times, thus have to run the exercise on their own. That means the randomness in the order of corners is missing.

With RacketGhost you get to have a ghosting coach on your mobile device, always ready to run a ghosting session with you!

## Getting Started

Using RacketGhost means following these steps:

1. Configure your ghosting session.
2. Put your mobile device in front of you on the court.
3. Press "GO!" to start your ghosting session. 
4. RacketGhost highlights court positions for you to reach.
5. Compare your recent session with your ghosting history.
6. Press "Back" to return to the main screen.

In the main screen you get to set the following parameters for your next ghosting session:

- Reps: The number of repetitions per set, i.e., the number of corners to reach. [DEFAULT=15]
- Sets: The number of sets in the ghosting session. [DEFAULT=3]
- Interval: The time (in milliseconds) between repetitions in the ghosting session. [DEFAULT=5500]
- Break btw. sets: The time (in seconds) to rest between sets. [DEFAULT=15]

Furthermore, there are two checkboxes [DEFAULT=CHECKED]:

- 6 corners: If checked, RacketGhost points you to six court positions, otherwise only the four corners are used.
- Audio: Play complementing audio

## Further Information

- The current version of RacketGhost is tailored for squash. Although it works fine for badminton as well, refering to court positions as volley left/right does obviously not make sense.
- To compensate for the shorter distances, the interval for volley positions is automatically decreased to 2/3 of the setting.
- In the main screen the last 3 ghosting sessions are listed, but in the summary screen 15 sessions are presented.
- Audio is at the moment not supported on all devices.
- You can stop an ongoing ghosting session by pressing "Stop". Press "Back" to return to the main screen.
