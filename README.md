# RacketGhost

- Ghosting Coach for Squash & Badminton 

## Background

Ghosting is an established training exercise in racket sports to practice court movement without a ball. Running to the various corners of the court improves both footwork and general stamina. In the best of worlds, your coach or sparring partner will always be ready to point you to random corners at a pace that pushes you to your limits.

Unfortunately, few people have access to a coach at all times, thus have to run the exercise on their own. That means the randomness in the order of corners is missing.

With RacketGhost you get to have a ghosting coach on your mobile device, always ready to run a ghosting session with you!
